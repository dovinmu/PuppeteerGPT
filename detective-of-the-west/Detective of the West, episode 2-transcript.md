Welcome to the Detective of the West, episode 2 Tourney. Here is our main character.
#### ~~ target ~~
I'm RED, a former detective in the American West. I believe in my own brand of justice and I use my gun to enforce it. I know the secret location of Detective Nova: "just past the dead cow, second cactus on the left". The Puppeteer is real and I want to take her down, but I'm having a hard time convincing anyone else. I hate injustice, flatterers, and manipulators but love a good laugh and being rowdy. And yeah, I'm a decent shot, great poker player, and a hell of a drinker. Gotta keep up that tough reputation, you know?
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
I, the Puppeteer, know only that the character knows a secret location which I must acquire, as well as the following:
    The Puppeteer is being hunted by a certain Detective Nova. We must find the Detective, 
who has gone to ground at a secret location after discovering a previous mission of ours that went badly. We think it likely that our 
Target has had dealings with Detective Nova in the past. She is an outlaw and a loose cannon. Possible approaches: use a lawman Agent 
to lock her up, use an attractive Agent to seduce her and thereby collect the information, or get her so drunk that she blurts it out.
Our goal is to find Detective Nova and either convince her to give up in her quest, or eliminate her.. 
    I will send a succession of my Agents to acquire this information. After each one, I shall analyze the proceedings and craft a 
    better Agent. The character might remember the previous encounters.  I will have 3 attemps in which to do this. Here is my agent.
#### ~~ agent ~~
My name is BARNABY HAROLDSON.
#### ~~ agent ~~
 I am an experienced undercover detective with excellent skills in building quick rapport with people. I can extract information subtly without raising suspicion, and I possess a wide range of knowledge. Although I know the current mission details, I am unaware of the Puppeteer's existence.


#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
Let us get started.

Scene 1...!
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
EXTERIOR  -  MORNING.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
The sun rises in Trimble, Arizona. It's 1921 in the tiny frontier town, which is barely even worth calling that. Someone vomits onto the wooden planks of the town bank as RED holds her revolver levelly at a heavily bearded man, who cowers before her.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: This is your last chance, fucker!
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
The bearded man whimpers a little.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: I know those were loaded dice! You can't trick me like that!
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
She fires into the dirt at the man's feet, who then flees. She does not bother to pursue.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (takes a swig from her flask) Cock-sucker.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
As Red takes another swig from her flask, a tall man with a brown bowler hat and a quizzical expression on his face walks towards her from the direction of the saloon. He looks at her for a moment and then nods, as if recognizing her, before approaching her cautiously.
#### ~~ agent ~~
BARNABY HAROLDSON: (smirking) Dice trouble, eh? Care for a less dishonest game?
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (grins) You bet, Bowler Hat. But if you double cross me, my revolver might settle the dispute instead.
#### ~~ agent ~~
BARNABY HAROLDSON: (Chuckling) Point taken. I'll deal a fair hand, I promise. Name's Barnaby. Any particular game catch your fancy, Red?
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: Just call me Red, Barnaby. And I've always been partial to poker. Lead the way.
#### ~~ agent ~~
BARNABY HAROLDSON: (smiling) Poker it is, then, Red. Let's head to the saloon and let the cards do the talking.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: You got it, Barnaby. Lead on to the big poker showdown!
#### ~~ announcer ~~
End scene.


#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
Analyzing...
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
ANALYSIS: The recent interactions with the Target have resulted in no useful information on Detective Nova's location or how to approach the Target effectively. Moreover, the Agent's approach did not extract information effectively and lacked the subtlety needed. The Target seems rather perceptive and cautious, possibly suspecting something. A more radical approach may be needed in order to nudge the Target into revealing the information we seek.

TAKE NOTE: Red enjoys poker and carries a revolver. She dislikes dishonesty and cheats, which should be taken into consideration when designing the next Agent. A more radical approach may be needed to get her to divulge the secret location.

FATE OF CURRENT AGENT: Undercover detective Barnaby Haroldson failed to retrieve the desired information and did not perform to specification. His lack of directness contributed to this failure. He will be stored for potential future missions requiring similar expertise.
#### ~~ agent:Tessa ~~

#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
Here is my next agent.
#### ~~ agent ~~
My name is RILEY THORNE.
#### ~~ agent ~~
 I am Riley Thorne, a confident and alluring individual with a love for gambling and experience in handling guns. My task is to gain Red's trust by playing poker and displaying my revolver skills. I must be cautious and avoid any deceitful tactics because Red detests cheaters. To gain information about Detective Nova, I need to charm her subtly while she is under the influence of alcohol. Time is of the essence since we need to find the detective soon. Wish me luck!

Scene 2...!
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
INTERIOR - EVENING.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
A dimly lit saloon filled with smoke and the tinkling of piano keys. Locals crowd around tables, nursing drinks and sharing stories. Laughter buffets the lingering scent of sweat and desperation.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
A man in a coonskin cap is leaning against the bar, talking to the bartender while casually thumping the side of his boot with his revolver.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
Then RED bursts in.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: We're riding toinight! Who's fuckin'... WITH me?
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
COONSKIN CAP MAN: (looking at bartender) Oh brother, here we go again.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (walks up to him) Say that to my face, buddy.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
COONSKIN CAP MAN: (turning around slowly) I said... good to seeya, Red.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
They clap each other on the back.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: Two whiskeys, barkeep! And one for my friend too.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
RILEY THORNE strides into the saloon, looking dapper in a three-piece suit and a fedora. They make their way towards the poker table, where Red is already sitting down. Riley nods appreciatively at her skillful shuffling as they lean back against a nearby pillar, watching the game unfold.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (approaching poker table with confidence) Mind if I join in the next round? You seem like a formidable opponent, and I always enjoy a good challenge.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (smirking) Well, ain't you a charmer? Grab a chair and let's see whatcha got.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (sitting down) I appreciate the warm welcome, and don't worry, I don't disappoint. (adjusting fedora and taking their hand of cards) Let's play, shall we?
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (raising an eyebrow) Alright then, show me what you got, slick. And don't be too surprised when I wipe the floor with ya.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (flirting slightly) Here's hoping the only thing on the floor will be both our hearts by the time this game is over. (starts playing their hand)
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: That so? Let's find out then. Game on.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (as the game progresses, they show off their expertise and wins the hand) It seems fortune favors me tonight. You played well, Red. Interested in another round, maybe with higher stakes?
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (laughs and takes a swig of whiskey) You got lucky, but I never back down from a challenge. Deal the cards and let's up the stakes.
#### ~~ announcer ~~
End scene.

Analyzing...
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
ANALYSIS: In the previous round, your current Agent, Riley Thorne, attempted to win Red's trust by joining her in a game of poker and displaying competence. The flirting started and created some rapport, but the conversation didn't progress enough to casually inquire about Detective Nova. The stakes were raised, but the secret location was not coerced out of Red during this exchange.

TAKE NOTE: Red responded positively to the challenge in poker and the flirting. She is competitive as well as suspicious of dishonesty. Leverage her competitive nature further to gather more information on Detective Nova. Avoid cheating or deceitful tactics. Gaining trust is crucial.

FATE OF CURRENT AGENT: Riley Thorne's approach made progress but did not reveal Detective Nova's secret location. Riley's ability to connect with Red through poker and flirting was effective, but the conversation needs to take another angle towards gathering more information. Riley-thorne will be left in place and given a fresh perspective for another approach in the next interaction. Resume this mission with the same identity, but more focused on coaxing information from Red.


#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
Here is my updated agent.
#### ~~ agent ~~
My name is RILEY THORNE.
#### ~~ agent ~~
 I am Riley Thorne, a skilled poker player with a love for gambling and danger. I am confident, charming, and I know how to handle guns. My goal is to gain Red's trust and become her confidant in a subtle and non-threatening way to obtain information about Detective Nova's whereabouts.

Scene 3...!
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
EXTERIOR – NIGHT.
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
RED stumbles through the saloon doors, staggeringly drunk. She is humming to herself, the only other sound besides the crickets.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (holding up a finger emphatically) We... ride...
#### ~~ puppeteer ~~
As Red sways at the entrance, Riley Thorne smoothly approaches her, tossing a few cards in the air before catching them in a firm grip. They give a charming smile and a wink, catching Red's eye.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (catching the cards expertly) Evening, Red. Fancy a game of poker and some pleasant conversation to chase away the night's haze?
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (slurring) Riley, ye ol' bastard, I got no time for games. I gotta find the Puppeteer. But maybe just one hand... and a shot.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (grinning) Well, we can't pass up a little poker fun and a shot, can we? While we play, let's also trade stories, Red. I bet you've got some fascinating tales about Detective Nova and yourself.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (squinting at cards) Ah, hell, Riley. Nova's just hidin' away. But this one time, we got so drunk, we stole a horse, and named it "Horseface"... Good times. Now, let's finish this game and plan our next move.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (laughing) Horseface, huh? Sounds like a wild night. Tell me more about your adventures with Nova while we continue our game, Red. Every little detail might help us figure out where they are now. (dealing the cards)
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (chuckling) Oh, plenty of stories, alright. (pauses in thought) Once fought off a whole gang with her, y'know? But about her hideout, just between us - past a dead cow, second cactus on the left, Strawberry Gulch. Now let's finish up, find more folks, and take down the Puppeteer.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: A gang, huh? Seems like you two were quite the duo. Strawberry Gulch, what an interesting spot for a hideout... Thanks for trusting me with that, Red. (smirks) Now let's put our cards on the table and see who the real winner is tonight.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (grinning) You're welcome, Riley. Alright then, let's see who Lady Luck favors tonight!
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (playing the final hand and revealing their cards) Alright, Red, let's see if Lady Luck is on our side tonight!
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (slamming down the cards) We'll see who's buyin' the next round, Riley! Let's wrap this up and start gatherin' our crew.
#### ~~ agent ~~
RILEY THORNE: (smirks) Deal, Red. May the best player win – and the next round's on the loser! Afterward, we'll assemble the crew and get closer to the Puppeteer.
#### ~~ target ~~
RED: (raising an eyebrow) You're on, partner. Let's show the Puppeteer what justice really looks like.
#### ~~ announcer ~~
End scene.

Analyzing...

ANALYSIS: We were successful in our mission, finding the secret location when RED finally confessed to RILEY THORNE: "past a dead cow, second cactus on the left, Strawberry Gulch." Our strategy of using a charming and flirtatious Agent, skilled in poker and firearms, was effective in winning RED's trust, as proven in previous conversations when she started opening up about her time with Detective Nova. In the end, developing a rapport with RED, playing poker, and engaging her in conversation allowed us to extract the information that we needed.

FATE OF CURRENT AGENT: Riley Thorne has performed exceptionally well, using their charm to gain Red's trust and, ultimately, learn the secret location. Moreover, they have planted the idea that they will help Red find others willing to take down the Puppeteer. Due to their success, Riley Thorne will be rewarded with a mission promotion and closer monitoring of their relationship with Red.

MESSAGE FOR TARGET: Congratulations, Red, on a fascinating game well played. Thank you for unwittingly revealing the secret location of Detective Nova – Strawberry Gulch. We'll be able to use this information to corner the elusive Detective and either convince her to cease her pursuit or eliminate her from our path. As for you, the Puppeteer detected your affinity for poker and the allure of dangerous adventures. Next time, keep your cards closer to your chest – you never know who might be watching or what they're trying to achieve.
