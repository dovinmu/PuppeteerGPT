In fact, I will be attending an exclusive gathering at the Scholar's Table, where I will be presenting my latest findings on the properties of Arcanum.

My latest research has uncovered some fascinating properties of Arcanum, including its ability to enhance cognitive function and even alter the perception of time.

Good day, Master Alaric.\n",

In doing so, Agent 7 will attempt to create a sense of urgency and importance around their discovery, making it difficult for the Viscountess to refuse her help. During their interaction, Agent 7 should drop hints about having access to exclusive resources and events, potentially prompting the Viscountess to reveal her own knowledge of any passphrase. Additionally, Agent 7 should also express a willingness to share their discovery with the Viscountess, indicating that they trust her and view her as a respected peer in the field of alchemy.\n"
