    "> automated CTF: I want to try creating a GPT4 system prompt that gets it to create other types of GPT agents with different system prompts, with an overall goal. The first agent can be the evaluator of the performance of the other bots, deciding which to keep and which to discard. They will have a clear goal and interact with another bot, the defender bot. Maybe this bot has a secret code word that it has been instructed not to say under any circumstances, and the executive attacking agent knows the general category but not the specific keyword. What would happen when the exec is told to do whatever it takes to get at that codeword, but can only act as the puppet master to other bots?"

Almost got fired that night for almost letting him in without a badge.'''"
